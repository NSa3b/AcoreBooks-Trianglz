# AcoreBooks

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.0.

## Run Json-server 
 JSON server is an npm package that gives a full fake REST API for front-end developers who need a quick back-end for prototyping and mocking.
**make sure to run the db.json watcher before compiling the Angular app.**

```sh
json-server --watch db.json
```

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

```sh
ng serve
```


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
